Just a personal preferance, you can ignore this if you know what you're doing. I personally recommend doing this on an Arch based distro since it's worked the best for me i can recommend CachyOS or EndeavourOS or just pure Arch if you want to.
Once you install hyprland you should have a ~/.config/hypr/ folder just place the files in the folder into the hypr folder and restart hyprland using hyprctl reload
